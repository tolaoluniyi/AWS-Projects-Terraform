The goal of this project is to create a VPC named "First-VPC" with an ipv4 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR and no ipv6 CIDR block, this VPC will have an internet gateway named "Public-gateway" attached to the VPC, and there will be two subnets in the VPC one named "public-subnet", with ipv4 CIDR of 10.0.1.0/24, which is the public facing subnet and the other "Private-subnet" with a CIDR of 10.0.2.0/24. create a "public-routetable" that points to the internet gateway ("public-gateway), which has been created in a previous step. The public subnet should be associated with the internet gateway. The private subnet will have a "Private-routetable" which it will be associated with, set inbound rules to accept all traffic and outbound traffic to accept all traffic as well.
Lastly create Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) private-NACL for the private subnet allow all traffic for inbound and outbound rule. Create the public-NACLset inbound traffic source as 0.0.0.0 and outbound trafic from everywhere. associate the NACLs with the appropriate subnets, private-NACL for private and public-NACL for public.
Create an EC2 Instance in both the public and private subnets and then use the user-data from the book to bootstrap the EC2 Instance, test the connection in the browser, you should be able to access the one in the public subnet but not the one in the private subnet.
All this should be achieved using terraform
